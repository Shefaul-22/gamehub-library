    "description": "Among Us is a social deduction game where teamwork and betrayal collide aboard space-themed environments. Players take on the roles of Crewmates or Impostors. Crewmates must complete tasks across the map while trying to identify Impostors among them. Meanwhile, Impostors sabotage systems, eliminate crewmates, and manipulate discussions to avoid suspicion.

Map variety—from The Skeld to Airship—adds unique layouts and task types. Custom game settings allow adjusting vision ranges, kill cooldowns, player speed, and number of Impostors, making matches highly customizable. Cosmetic skins, hats, and pets add personality. The game supports cross-play across platforms, making it easy for friends to play together. Regular updates introduce new roles, maps, and quality-of-life improvements. Among Us stands out as a fun, chaotic, and social experience that becomes even more entertaining with larger groups or voice chat.",
